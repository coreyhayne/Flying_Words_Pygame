Words fly across the screen for the player to type out the words.
For each character the user types in correct, the character turns green, the rest are black
If the user types in the wrong character in the word, they have to restart typing the word
Ever correct word adds points
If the word hits the right side of the screen, it is game over.
The game over screen will display and show how many points the player received.

Furture updaates to come:
1. Adding different levels for the user to choose from (easy/medium/hard) Each level will contain different lengths of words and a different speed at which the words scroll across the screen
2. Once gameover, allow the user to either choose to play again or quit the game.
